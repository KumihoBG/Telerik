//Problem 2. Gravitation on the Moon

//The gravitational field of the Moon is approximately 17% of that on the Earth.
//Write a program that calculates the weight of a man on the moon by a given weight on the Earth.
//Examples:

//weight	weight on the Moon
//86	14.62
//74.6	12.682
//53.7	9.129
using System;


class Gravitation
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Enter the weight if a man:");
        float weight = float.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
        Console.WriteLine(weight*0.17);
    }
}
