Problem 1. Strings in C#.

Describe the strings in C#.
What is typical for the string data type?
Describe the most important methods of the String class.

1/
According to Microsoft, a string is an object of type String whose value is text. 
Internally, the text is stored as a sequential read-only collection of Char objects. 
There is no null-terminating character at the end of a C# string; 
therefore a C# string can contain any number of embedded null characters ('\0'). 
The Length property of a string represents the number of Char objects it contains, 
not the number of Unicode characters. 
In C#, the string keyword is an alias for String. 
Therefore, String and string are equivalent, and you can use whichever naming 
convention you prefer. 

2/ 
The string data type:
- Represents text as a series of Unicode characters;
- It is a reference type;
- It is immutable (read-only)- it acts like the primitive data types; the contents of 
a string object cannot be changed after the object is created, although the syntax 
makes it appear as if you can do this.

A very detailed information about the most important methods of the String class could be
found here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string_methods%28v=vs.110%29.aspx
Among them are: .Compare(), .CompareTo(), .Split, .Join, .Replace, .Remove, IndexOf, LastIndexOf,
.Concat(), Equals(), .Contains, .Format and so forth.
